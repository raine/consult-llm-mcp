# Changelog

## v3.0.8 (2026-04-27)

- `install-skills` interactive prompt now installs to a single platform per run; re-run the command to install to another platform
- Workflow skills are now discoverable by model invocation again (removed `disable-model-invocation` from `collab`, `collab-vs`, `debate`, `debate-vs`, `implement`, `panel`, `review-panel`, and `workshop`)

## v3.0.7 (2026-04-27)

- `doctor` now validates the configured cursor model and reasoning effort against `cursor-agent --list-models` and reports a hard error when the combination would be rejected (e.g. `gpt-5.5` only accepts `medium`/`high`/`extra-high`)
- Cursor backend now maps `low` → `medium` and `xhigh` → `extra-high` when targeting `gpt-5.5`, so existing `codex_reasoning_effort` configs keep working
- `implement` skill now verifies reviewer findings empirically before adopting them, reducing churn from hallucinated or contrived issues

## v3.0.5 (2026-04-26)

- Added new skills: `implement`, `workshop`, `panel`, and `review-panel`
- Config discovery now walks past nested `.git` directories so configs in parent repos are found from inside submodules or worktrees
- Workflow skills set `disable-model-invocation` so they only run when explicitly invoked

## v3.0.4 (2026-04-26)

- Added support for passing extra CLI arguments to the `codex` and `gemini` backends
- `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is now honored when resolving the user config file
- Monitor: detail view now wraps text based on terminal width, and the Model column is sized to fit the longest model name
- When all consultations fail, per-model error messages are now included in the output

## v3.0.3 (2026-04-26)

- API executors now stream responses via SSE for faster, incremental output
- Reasoning/thinking output is now surfaced for Gemini, DeepSeek, and other reasoning models when using API backends
- `install-skills` now has an interactive multi-select UI for choosing which platforms to install to, with no platforms pre-selected

## v3.0.1 (2026-04-26)

- `consult-llm` is now published to crates.io and can be installed with `cargo install consult-llm`

## v3.0.0 (2026-04-26)

- **Migrated from MCP server to standalone CLI.** `consult-llm` is now a
  native binary invoked directly in the terminal or from agent skills via
  Bash. The MCP server, rmcp runtime, and npm packaging have been removed.
  Skills have been rewritten to invoke the CLI instead of the MCP tool.
- Package renamed from `consult-llm-mcp` to `consult-llm`
- Added Homebrew tap: `brew install raine/consult-llm/consult-llm`
- Added layered YAML config file support. Settings can now be declared in
  `~/.config/consult-llm/config.yaml` (user), `.consult-llm.yaml`
  (project, committed), or `.consult-llm.local.yaml` (local overrides, not
  committed). Environment variables still take highest precedence
- API keys can now be stored in `.consult-llm.local.yaml` or the user
  config file. Writing `api_key` to the committed project config is blocked
  to prevent accidental secret exposure
- Added `consult-llm config set <key> <value>` subcommand for editing YAML
  config from the CLI using dot-notation keys (e.g.
  `consult-llm config set gemini.backend gemini-cli`)
- Added `consult-llm install-skills` subcommand. Replaces the curl-piped
  shell script; skill files are bundled at compile time and written to the
  detected platform directories (`~/.claude/skills/`,
  `~/.config/opencode/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/`)
- Added `consult-llm docs` subcommand that prints the bundled README to
  stdout
- Added parallel multi-model support: pass `-m` multiple times
  (e.g. `-m gemini -m openai`) to query models concurrently in a single
  call. Multi-turn group threads are supported via the returned
  `group_<uuid>` thread ID
- Added `--run <spec>` flag for per-model runs, enabling different prompt
  bodies to be sent to different models in a single invocation
- Moved user config directory from `~/.consult-llm/` to
  `~/.config/consult-llm/` for XDG Base Directory compliance. Supports
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. The legacy `~/.consult-llm/` path is still read for
  backward compatibility, and existing configs are auto-migrated on startup
- Monitor: use full worktree name as project identifier in the TUI

## v2.13.4 (2026-04-24)

- Updated DeepSeek model from `deepseek-reasoner` to `deepseek-v4-pro`. The
  `deepseek` selector now resolves to the new model

## v2.13.3 (2026-04-23)

- Added gpt-5.5 model support ($5/$30 per million tokens). The `openai` selector
  now resolves to gpt-5.5, and the Cursor CLI backend automatically appends the
  reasoning effort suffix when routing through cursor-agent

## v2.13.2 (2026-04-22)

- Added Anthropic provider support with the `claude-opus-4-7` model. Configure
  with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; select via the `anthropic` selector or the exact
  model ID. API backend only (no CLI backend).
- Monitor: press `K` on an active consultation to kill a stuck agent process
  after confirming
- Fixed cursor-cli backend failing with "Cannot use this model: gpt-5.4" when
  using the `openai` selector, by automatically appending the reasoning effort
  suffix

## v2.13.1 (2026-04-08)

- Monitor now shows the full error message in the detail view when a
  consultation fails, instead of only indicating failure
- Improved startup logging: available models are now logged with their backends,
  and the working directory is included in the server start log
- System prompts for review and plan modes now encourage bolder architectural
  recommendations rather than defaulting to minimal changes

## v2.13.0 (2026-03-29)

- Monitor: press `r` in detail view to jump directly to the response section,
  available in both single consultation and thread detail views

## v2.12.1 (2026-03-28)

- CLI backends now receive prompts via stdin instead of command-line arguments,
  avoiding exposure in `ps` output and ARG_MAX limits with large prompts

## v2.12.0 (2026-03-28)

- Added OpenCode CLI as a new backend option, routing models through OpenCode's
  75+ providers (Copilot, OpenRouter, Ollama, etc.) without needing direct API
  keys. Configure per-provider with `CONSULT_LLM_OPENCODE_<FAMILY>_PROVIDER` env
  vars. Supports multi-turn via `--session` and file refs via `--file`.
- Added MiniMax M2.7 provider support
- DeepSeek and MiniMax backends are now configurable (previously hardcoded to
  API-only), enabling e.g. `CONSULT_LLM_MINIMAX_BACKEND=opencode`

## v2.11.0 (2026-03-27)

- Added multi-turn thread support for API backends. Threads are stored as JSON
  files under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/consult-llm-mcp/threads/` and replayed as the
  messages array on each call. Expired threads (>7 days) are cleaned up
  automatically. All backends now support `thread_id`.
- Fixed API cost tracking undercounting tokens for thinking models (e.g.
  gemini-3.1-pro-preview). Thinking tokens excluded from `completion_tokens` are
  now derived from `total_tokens`.
- Monitor: show cost information in history table, detail view header, usage
  separator lines, and thread detail header. Cost is only shown for API backend
  consultations.
- Monitor: show files as compact path list in detail view instead of inlined
  file contents
- Fixed `reasoning_effort` incorrectly showing for non-codex models on
  cursor_cli backend

## v2.10.0 (2026-03-15)

- Monitor: cycle between sibling consultations (started around the same time)
  with Tab/Shift+Tab in detail view
- Monitor: sort projects by most recent consultation activity
- Monitor: add Esc key to quit from table view

## v2.9.0 (2026-03-14)

- Added `consult-llm-mcp update` self-update command. Updates both
  `consult-llm-mcp` and `consult-llm-monitor` if present.

## v2.8.0 (2026-03-13)

- Replaced hardcoded model enum with abstract selectors (`gemini`, `openai`,
  `deepseek`) that resolve to the best available model at query time. This
  avoids the need to hardcode a specific model in the caller side.
- Responses now include a `[model:xxx]` prefix showing which concrete model was
  used
- Default Codex reasoning effort to "high" (was previously unset)
- Monitor: added Task column to active and history tables
- Monitor: show task mode and reasoning effort in detail view header
- Monitor: press `s` in detail view to toggle system prompt display
- Monitor: system prompt is now recorded in sidecar event files for viewing in
  the TUI

  x64/arm64) via npm with a POSIX sh launcher
- Added `MCP_DEBUG_STDIN` env var for raw stdin transport logging

## v2.5.3 (2026-03-06)

- Added `CONSULT_LLM_` prefix to backend and reasoning effort env vars:
  `CONSULT_LLM_GEMINI_BACKEND`, `CONSULT_LLM_OPENAI_BACKEND`,
  `CONSULT_LLM_CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT`. Old unprefixed names still work with a
  deprecation warning.

## v2.5.2 (2026-03-06)
